# Explainable AI (XAI) Methods for Reinforcement of Object Recognition and Localization in the Wild Egocentric Videos

This project explores Explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance object recognition and localization in egocentric videos, focusing on wild and dynamic environments. It aims to improve the interpretability and reliability of object detection models through various explainability techniques, which can be used to reinforce object recognition and localization in real-time video streams.

## Overview

The project applies three key explainability methods to evaluate and analyze object recognition and localization:
- **Object Recognition**: Detects and identifies objects in egocentric (first-person) video frames.
- **Localization**: Finds the position of detected objects in the frames.
- **Explainability**: Provides insights into which features contribute the most to model decisions.
