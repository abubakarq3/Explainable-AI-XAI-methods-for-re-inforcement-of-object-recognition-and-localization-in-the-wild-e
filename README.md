# Explainable AI (XAI) Methods for Reinforcement of Object Recognition and Localization in the Wild Egocentric Videos

In this study, we applied three explainers to analyze features contributing to object recognition and localization by YOLOv8. We evaluated these explainers against ground truth data, using gaze fixation density maps, and computed the Pearson correlation coefficient. Our findings show that the FEM method aligns best with the ground truth
